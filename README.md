# MetroHelper

MetroHelper is an application for finding the shortest way to the subway.

The entire application is based on React 18.1 + Redux. The metro map is made in SVG format, which allows you to achieve better performance in contrast to Canvas. For competent control of the image size of the metro map, as well as for smooth zoom, the library was used D3.js .
